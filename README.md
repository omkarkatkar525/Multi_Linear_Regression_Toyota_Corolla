```sh
When input variables and output variable is having linear relationship we can use this Regression model. 
This correlation between input and output variables can be positive or negative.
When there are more then one independent variables and one dependent variable then that is Multi-Linear regression. 
Both input variables and output variable should be continuous.  
```

## Data Used :
```sh
50_startups: Prepare a prediction model for profit of 50_startups data.
ToyotaCorolla: prepare a prediction model for predicting Price of ToyotaCorolla data.
